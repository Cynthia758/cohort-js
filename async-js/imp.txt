I/O bound task :
Tasks that are limited by how fast input/output operations happen â€” like reading files, making API calls, or querying a database.
âœ… Examples:
Reading/writing to a file
Calling an API or loading a webpage
Accessing a database
Uploading/downloading files
ðŸ“¦ Node.js is great at I/O-bound tasks because it can handle them asynchronously without blocking.


ðŸ§® CPU-bound task
Tasks that are limited by the processing power (CPU), usually involving intense calculations.
ðŸ§  CPU works hard, doesnâ€™t rest.
ðŸ•’ Waiting time is due to how long computations take.
âœ… Examples:
Complex mathematical calculations
Image or video processing
Sorting large data sets
Running heavy loops or algorithms (like encryption)
ðŸ“¦ Node.js is not great at CPU-bound tasks by default, because one heavy task can block everything else â€” unless you use Worker Threads.

ðŸ’¡ Analogy:
I/O-bound is like waiting in line at a store â€” youâ€™re not doing anything, just waiting.
CPU-bound is like solving a big math puzzle â€” youâ€™re actively thinking the whole time.
