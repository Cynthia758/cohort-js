// It is just another class which JS provides us.
// The promise class as the name suggests it gives us the promise that it will return something in the future.
// We can use callbacks based aproach or promise based approach for the journey. They are usable interchangebly. 
// A promise in JS is an object that represents the eventual completion of an async operation and its resulting value.

setTimeoutPromisified(2000).then(long); // If we just write it as it is then it will give us an error so we have to define the promisified function somewhere line 12 to 16.
// your intuition was right: they(call backs and promises) donâ€™t run exactly at the same instant; Promise callbacks have priority over plain timeout callbacks.
